    <h2>What I Learned?</h2>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to structure and display content on the web. It uses tags
        to
        organize text, images, links, and other elements. </p>

    <h2>Steps to Make a Webpage in HTML</h2>
    <b>Create a New File:</b>
    <p>Open a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code) and save your file with the .html extension (for example,
        "index.html").</p>

    <b>Define the HTML Structure:</b>
    <p>Start by declaring the document type. Then, mark the beginning of the HTML document.</p>

    <b>Create the Head Section:</b>
    <p>In the head section, give your webpage a title (this appears in the browser tab). You can also add other details
        like
        character encoding and instructions for responsiveness on different devices.</p>

    <b>Add Content Inside the Body:</b>
    <p>In the body section of your webpage, write the main content, like headings, paragraphs, and links. For instance,
        add a
        main heading, a few lines of text, and a link to another webpage.</p>

    <b>Save and View in Browser:</b>
    <p>After saving your file, open it in a web browser to view how it looks.</p>
